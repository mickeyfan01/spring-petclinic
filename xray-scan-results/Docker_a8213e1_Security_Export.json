            "FullDescription": "[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",

It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",

            "FullDescription": "[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/) is a network authentication protocol. It is designed to provide strong authentication for client/server applications by using secret-key cryptography. A free implementation of this protocol is available from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Kerberos is available in many commercial products as well.\n\nA [Kerberos database](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/database.html) contains all of a realm’s Kerberos principals, their passwords, and other administrative information about each principal. For the most part, you will use the `kdb5_util` program to manipulate the Kerberos database as a whole, and the `kadmin` program to make changes to the entries in the database. \n\nIn `kdb5_util`, there is a `process_k5beta7_princ` method responsible for adding Kerberos 5 beta 7 format data from a file to the Kerberos database. This function is vulnerable to integer overflow as a Database entry defined on 16-bits is assigned a 32-bits value from the given file. It turns out that it does not have any impact at all and it is not a security flaw.\n\nOriginally, the vulnerability was mistakenly reported as an Integer Overflow.\nThe issue should not affect any other data allocated close to the 16-bit integer in question. Furthermore, a negative value of the 16-bit integer does not impact the flow of the program in any meaningful way.\n\nTo trigger the integer truncation, an attacker has to get the user to use the `kdb5_util` utility to restore a Kerberos 5 - beta 7 format - database from a crafted malicious file. It can be done using the following command:\n```\nkdb5_util load -d DB_NAME DB_FILE \n```",
